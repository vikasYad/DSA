The StringBuilder class in Java provides several built-in methods for manipulating and working with mutable strings. Here are some commonly used methods of the StringBuilder class:

append(...): Appends the specified argument to the end of the string.
insert(int offset, ...): Inserts the specified argument at the specified position.
delete(int start, int end): Deletes the characters from the specified start index (inclusive) to the end index (exclusive).
deleteCharAt(int index): Deletes the character at the specified index.
replace(int start, int end, String str): Replaces the characters from the specified start index (inclusive) to the end index (exclusive) with the specified string.
substring(int start): Returns a new StringBuilder that is a substring of the original StringBuilder, starting from the specified index.
substring(int start, int end): Returns a new StringBuilder that is a substring of the original StringBuilder, starting from the start index and ending at the end index-1.
reverse(): Reverses the characters in the StringBuilder.
length(): Returns the number of characters in the StringBuilder.
charAt(int index): Returns the character at the specified index.
setCharAt(int index, char ch): Sets the character at the specified index to the specified character.
indexOf(String str): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified string within the StringBuilder.
lastIndexOf(String str): Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified string within the StringBuilder.
toString(): Converts the StringBuilder to a String.
These are just a few examples of the methods available in the StringBuilder class. The class provides many more methods for various string manipulation operations. You can refer to the official Java documentation for a comprehensive list of methods available in the StringBuilder class.
